# ConcurrentModificationError in Dart

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  `ConcurrentModificationError`. This error occurs when you modify a list (add, remove, or change elements) while iterating over it using methods like `forEach`.

The `bug.dart` file contains the code that produces the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution to this problem.  This is a frequent pitfall for beginners, and understanding this error is crucial for robust Dart development.
